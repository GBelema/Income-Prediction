# Income-Prediction
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50K based on demographic and work-related attributes.
The dataset used is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository's Adult Census dataset. This is a binary classification problem, aiming to classify individuals into either <=50K or >50K income brackets.

Objectives
Data Exploration: Understand the characteristics and distribution of the dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
Feature Engineering: Engineer relevant features to enhance the predictive power of the model.
Model Building: Train various machine learning models to identify the best performing one.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Model Tuning: Fine-tune the model using hyperparameter optimization to achieve the best performance.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Adult Income dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various demographic information, including:

Age: Age of the individual.
Workclass: Type of employer (e.g., Private, Government, Self-employed).
Education: Highest level of education attained.
Marital Status: Marital status of the individual.
Occupation: Type of job.
Hours-per-week: Average number of work hours per week.
Income: Target variable - whether the income is <=50K or >50K.

Approach
Data Exploration:
Visualize distributions, correlations, and identify data anomalies.
Explore relationships between features and the target variable.
Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Normalize or standardize numerical features.
Feature Engineering:
Create new features to capture useful patterns.
Perform feature selection to reduce dimensionality.
Model Training:
Train different classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Use cross-validation to validate model performance.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Model Tuning:
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
Ensemble techniques for improving model performance.
Results
The best model achieved an accuracy of X% and an F1-score of Y. The model showed strong predictive power in identifying individuals likely to earn more than $50K, with a balanced trade-off between precision and recall.
